#### Advanced AntiCheat Config
#### Rechosen by Caleb Anderson, Developer of KnightFall
#### You shouldn't recieve too many false positives using this Config. If you do, another plugin is preventing AAC from working correctly

# Be sure to check language.yml for configuration regarding staff chat, etc.

## If you need any help configuring AAC, or you're getting false positives and you don't know why, feel free to PM konsolas on Spigot.
