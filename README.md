# AACconfig
Optimized Configuration File for AAC (Advanced AntiCheat)

Please note: This config version is only for Advanced AntiCheat versions for Minecraft 1.8.x. Attempting to use this for version 1.9 of Advanced AntiCheat WILL BREAK IT. This configuration works best with vanilla servers, but allows usage and variation in case of other plugins, mcMMO, EnchantsPlus, and other CE plugins/custom combat modifications that are server side. 

I do not accept any liability that comes with using this config. This config is optimized in a certain way. Change values at your own risk, and feel free to experiment. This file will always be available for download.
